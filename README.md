OUR ORGANISATION IS A DONATING ORGANISATION AND WILL USE THIS MONEY TO HELP ANIMALS WITH VERY MILD PROFITS. PLZ DONATE BY ACCESING THE OTHER LINK

Pets like dogs, cats, birds give emotional support and reduce stress and are used in therapy for kids, elders and people with special needs.

Frogs, bees and birds signal pollution, disease or climate change.

Animals like sheep and silkworms provide humans materials like fibres and clothes

Some ants grow fungus for underground food, while others aerate the soil like mini ploughs, helping crops grow better.


This is my school project, please help me by donating!!!
